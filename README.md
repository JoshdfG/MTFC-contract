Simple Registry Contract
This Solidity smart contract, named SimpleRegistry, provides a basic functionality for storing and updating information about an entity, including their name and age. It serves as a simple registry system on the Ethereum blockchain.

Overview
The contract has the following features:

Initialization: Upon deployment, the contract is initialized with the name and age of the entity.

Updating Name and Age: The contract provides functions to update the entity's name (updateName) and age (updateAge).

Retrieving Entity Details: Users can retrieve the entity's name and age through the getEntityDetails function.

Usage
Deployment
To deploy the contract, you need to provide the initial name and age of the entity. This can be done by deploying the contract through a Solidity development environment or using a platform like Remix.

Interacting with the Contract
Once deployed, users can interact with the contract in the following ways:

Updating Entity Information: Users can update the entity's name and age by calling the updateName and updateAge functions, respectively. They need to provide the new name or age as parameters.

Retrieving Entity Details: To retrieve the entity's details, users can call the getEntityDetails function. This function returns the current name and age of the entity.

Security Considerations
Access Control: As it stands, there are no access controls implemented in this contract. Consider adding access control mechanisms if needed, to restrict who can update the entity's information.

Data Validation: The contract assumes that inputs provided for updating the name and age are valid. Additional validation logic can be implemented to ensure data integrity.
